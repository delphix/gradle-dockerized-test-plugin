0.5.1

* Gradle 3.4 support

0.5

* use docker-java client instead local docker cli for communication with Docker host
* added beforeContainerCreate, afterContainerCreate, beforeContainerStart, afterContainerStart, afterContainerStop
  interceptors that enable hooking/customizing the testing process
* removed support for inspectArgs closure, use beforeContainerCreate closure instead
* a custom client can be specified via client property of the docker extension. The property can point to a DockerClient
  instance, or to a closure that is invoked before a test worker container. This opens up the possibility to run
  tests in a cluster, applying custom scheduling mechanism.

0.4.2

* Gradle 2.14 support

0.4.1

* fixed calculation of max workers when no test tasks are executed through docker

0.4

* Improved test queue management over the default used by Gradle test tasks.
  This leads to better usage of available resources and much shorter test rounds
  when running tests in parallel (test.maxParallelForks > 1)
